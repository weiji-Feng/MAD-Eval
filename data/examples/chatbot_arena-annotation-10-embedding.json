(Typically, an implementation point will map to a small self-contained routine or check in code that can be independently tested.)\n\n- A *conditional clause* is a type of clause that expresses a condition or introduces a condition in a sentence, paragraph or larger structure. Conditional clauses establish a conditional scope or context under which one or more conditions hold.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe overarching goal of this project is to implement a complete and accurate ISO C90 front-end in Python with all code traceable to the standard document. So we need to ensure that we have identified and implemented everything that is in the standard. Using ANLTR4 and Python 3.10 we have implemented a parser, AST, AST builder, symbol table and representation of C90 types.\n\nWe are tasked with identifying and extracting all implementation points from the ISO C90 programming language standard. These will later be organised and annotated, and then used as inputs to an automated implementation and auditing pipeline.\n\nTask Description:\n\nFor each grammar rule in the C language there is a subsection in the ISO C90 standard. These subsections have subheadings for \"constraints\" and \"semantics\", within these sections there are statements that need to be translated into implementation points. The standard provides the following definition of \"constraints\"\"\n\n* Constraints --- syntactic and semantic restrictions by which the exposition of language elements is to be interpreted.\n\nHere is section 6.7.1 \"Function definitions\":\n\n```html\n<h4><a name=\"6.7.1\">6.7.1 Function definitions</a></h4>\n<h6>Syntax</h6>\n<p class=\"syntax-def\">\n<span class=\"nonterm\"><a name=\"function-definition\">function-definition</a></span>:<br/>\n</p>\n<p class=\"nonterm-defseq\">\n<span class=\"nonterm\"><a href=\"#declaration-specifiers\">declaration-specifiers</a><sub>opt</sub></span>\n<span class=\"nonterm\"><a href=\"#declarator\">declarator</a></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"nonterm-defseq\">\n<span class=\"nonterm\"><a href=\"#declaration-list\">declaration-list</a><sub>opt</sub></span>\n<span class=\"nonterm\"><a href=\"#compound-statement\">compound-statement</a></span>\n</p>\n<h6>Constraints</h6>\n<p>\n        The identifier declared in a function definition (which is the name\n        of the function) shall have a function type, as specified by the\n        declarator portion of the function definition.<sup><a href=\"#70\">70</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>\n        The return ",

It uses probabilistic models.\n\n2. Language modeling has applications in machine translation, speech recognition, and text generation.\n\n3. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method for estimating probabilities from observed data. It suffers from data sparsity and overfitting. \n\n4. The Markov assumption states that the probability of a future state depends only on a limited number of past states. N-gram models are based on this assumption.\n\n5. N-gram models are probabilistic language models that predict the next word based on the previous N-1 words. Bigrams model two-word sequences, trigrams model three-word sequences, and so on.\n\n6. Smoothing techniques like additive smoothing, interpolation, and back-off are used to address data sparsity and overfitting in N-gram models. \n\n7. Additive smoothing assigns a small non-zero probability to unseen events. It uses pseudocounts.\n\n8. Interpolation combines probabilities from different N-gram models. Linear interpolation is a common approach.\n\n9. Back-off falls back to a lower-order N-gram model when higher-order probabilities are unavailable. It uses back-off factors to determine how much probability mass is passed back.\n\n10. N-gram models have limitations like data sparsity at higher orders and the inability to model long-distance dependencies.\n\nThe key concepts are:\n- Probabilistic models and maximum likelihood estimation\n- The Markov assumption and N-gram models \n- Smoothing techniques like additive smoothing, interpolation, and back-off\n- Applications of language modeling like machine translation and speech recognition\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

One day, a hungry and tired wolf came to her door, begging for a bite to eat and a place to rest. Rotkäppchen, who was feeling lonely and wanted some company, decided to take the wolf in and offer him a bed for the night. Once inside, the wolf asked her to make him a hot bath and some food. As Rotkäppchen was preparing the bath and the food, the wolf noticed her beauty and asked her to stay for a nightcap. As they talked and laughed over their drinks, the wolf became more and more enchanted with her beauty and charm. Eventually, the night grew late, and Rotkäppchen invited the wolf to stay the night. That night, Rotkäppchen and the wolf shared a passionate and magical love that neither would ever forget.",

The FBI is called in and they discover a new tattoo on Jane's body, a winding snake shape, giving them their next clue.\n\nAct I: The team analyzes the tattoo and determines it refers to a former CIA operative code-named “The Snake” who went rogue a decade ago. The victim in the park was a low-level enforcer for an organized crime syndicate. Jane and Kurt go undercover to infiltrate the syndicate, hoping The Snake will make contact with them.\n\nAct II: Jane and Kurt have to prove themselves to the syndicate to gain their trust. They pull off a dangerous heist to earn credibility. Meanwhile, the team finds that The Snake is killing off people related to a past CIA mission gone wrong in Colombia. The Snake is enacting revenge and covering his tracks.\n\nAct III: Jane and Kurt finally make contact with The Snake, who recognizes Jane as “Remi” from her past life. But Kurt's cover is blown and The Snake takes him hostage. Jane has to decide between saving Kurt or apprehending The Snake. She chooses Kurt. In a climactic fight scene, Jane defeats The Snake and rescues Kurt.\n\nTag: With The Snake now in custody, Jane has more questions about her mysterious past life as Remi. But Kurt reassures her that her new life as an FBI agent is what really matters. They share a tender moment, their partnership stronger than ever.\n\nThis hits some of the typical beats and tropes of a Blindspot episode with an action-packed case of the week, clues from Jane’s tattoos, Jane’s dual identity, and Jane and Kurt’s partnership. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the episode in any way. I’d be happy to generate additional details and plot points to flesh it out further.",

The facility housed confidential files and data related to national security. The team discovers that the bomb was planted by a group of terrorists who are trying to steal the data to use it for their own agenda.\n\nAs the team investigates, they find clues that lead them to a hacker who is known for his skills in breaking into highly secure systems. Upon questioning the hacker, they discover that he was hired by an unknown person to steal the data. The team is puzzled by the motive behind the theft as the data seems to have no direct connection to any terrorist activity.\n\nMeanwhile, Patterson discovers a hidden agenda in the data that was stolen. The data contained crucial information about a secret government program that was being developed to create a super soldier. The program was highly controversial and had been abandoned due to ethical concerns. However, some government officials were still secretly funding the project.\n\nThe team realizes that the terrorists were not after the data for their own use, but they were hired by someone who wanted to expose the government's secret program. The team finds out that the person who hired the terrorists was a whistleblower who was trying to expose the unethical practices of the government.\n\nThe team now has to decide whether to support the whistleblower or to protect the government's secrets. As they try to make their decision, they discover that the whistleblower has been targeted by the government officials who are trying to silence him.\n\nIn the end, the team decides to support the whistleblower and work towards exposing the unethical practices of the government. The episode ends with the team successfully exposing the government's secret program and the whistleblower being hailed as a hero for his bravery in standing up against corruption.",

It also defines a struct `MyParser` and a trait `Parser` with a method `from_str`. The `Parser` trait is implemented for the `Event<'_>` struct, but it returns an `Event<'static>` instead of a `& Event`. This is because the `Event` struct has a lifetime parameter `'a`, which is different from the lifetime parameter of the return value.\n\nThe error in the code is that the return value `Event<'static>` is referencing data that is owned by the current function, and it is not possible to return a value that references data owned by the function. To fix this, the `Event` struct should be designed to return a lifetime `'static` value, that is, a value that has the same lifetime as the struct it is part of.\n\nThe following is one way to do this:\n```\nstruct Event<'a> {\n    line: String,\n    uid: &'a str,\n    lat: &'a str,\n    lon: &'a str,\n    hour: &'a str,\n}\n\nstruct MyParser;\n\ntrait Parser<F> {\n    fn from_str(line: String) -> F<'static>;\n}\n\nimpl Parser<Event<'_>> for MyParser {\n    fn from_str(line: String) -> Event<'static> {\n        let parts: Vec<&str> = line.split(\",\").collect();\n        let uid = parts[0];\n        let lat = parts[1];\n        let lon = parts[2];\n        let hour = parts[3];\n\n        Event { line, uid, lat, lon, hour }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the struct `Event` is designed to return a lifetime `'static` value, which is a struct that has the same lifetime as the struct it is part of. The return value is then passed to the `from_str` method, which creates an `Event` struct with the same fields and lifetime `'static`. This way, the `Event` struct can reference the fields of the struct it is part of without violating the lifetime constraints.\n\nThis is not the only way to do this, and there are other ways to design the `Event` struct and implement the `Parser` trait, but this is one way to do it.",

Mein Tag war auch erfolgreich und produktiv, ich habe an verschiedenen Projekten gearbeitet und ein paar wichtige Entscheidungen getroffen. Ich hoffe, dass die kommende Woche für uns beide ebenso erfolgreich wird. Wie sehen deine Pläne für die nächsten Tage aus?\n\nJosephine Eklund, [15.05.23 23:16]\nGuten Abend Jeff, mir geht es gut. Mir ist aufgefallen, dass du bei deiner Arbeit nicht viel Zeit hast.  In den nächsten Tagen werde ich mich meinen normalen Aktivitäten widmen und mich um das Fitnessstudio kümmern.\nWelche wichtigen Entscheidungen haben du getroffen?\n\nJeff L, [23.05.23 19:19]\nGuten Abend Josephine, entschuldige erneut für die späte Antwort. Du hast recht, meine Arbeit ist oft sehr zeitaufwendig und ich komme nicht immer dazu, rechtzeitig zu antworten. Die wichtigen Entscheidungen, die ich getroffen habe, betreffen hauptsächlich die Planung und Umsetzung einiger Projekte. Wir haben uns für bestimmte Materialien und Designansätze entschieden, um den Anforderungen unserer Kunden gerecht zu werden. Es ist immer eine Herausforderung, die richtige Balance zwischen Ästhetik, Funktionalität und Nachhaltigkeit zu finden.\n\nIch wünsche dir viel Spaß und Erfolg im Fitnessstudio. Es ist wichtig, sich um die eigene Gesundheit und Fitness zu kümmern. Wie oft gehst du ins Fitnessstudio und welche Art von Training machst du am liebsten?\n\nJosephine Eklund, [30.05.23 22:38]\nGuten Abend Jeff, wie geht es dir?. Danke für deine Wünsche. Abhängig von meiner Routine gehe ich oft viermal pro Woche ins Fitnessstudio und mein Lieblingstraining sind Ausfallschritte. Ich verstehe, dass es manchmal schwierig sein kann, die Arbeit zu bewältigen und sich auch um andere Aktivitäten zu kümmern.\n\nZu Ihrer passenden Zeit, Ich möchte einige nützliche Ideen mit Ihnen teilen.\nIch wünsche Ihnen einen schönen Abend.\n\nJeff L, [31.05.23 12:44]\nGuten Morgen Josephine.

The impact of human activities on the environment is rapidly changing the world we live in, and it is up to us to take action to protect our planet.\n\nClimate change is a natural process that has always occurred, but the speed at which it is happening is unprecedented. Rising temperatures, melting polar ice caps, and changes in weather patterns are just a few of the consequences of our actions. These changes are not only affecting the environment, but they are also having a significant impact on human populations, including those who are most vulnerable.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the solutions to this problem will not be easy, and they will require cooperation and collaboration from governments, businesses, and individuals around the world. We cannot simply hope that the problem will go away on its own. Instead, we must take bold and decisive action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect our natural resources, and adapt to the changes that are already underway.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge you to join me in this fight to protect our planet. Together, we can make a difference and ensure that future generations inherit a world that is healthier and more sustainable. Thank you.",

Growing up, she always had a natural curiosity about the world around her, constantly asking questions and seeking out new experiences. This curiosity eventually led her to pursue a career in journalism, where she could use her skills to uncover the truth and shed light on important issues.\n\nAfter graduating from college with a degree in journalism, Olivia worked for a local newspaper for a few years, honing her skills and building up her portfolio. But she knew that if she really wanted to make a difference, she would need to take her career to the next level.\n\nSo, she packed up her belongings and moved to the city, where she landed a job at a major news outlet. It wasn't easy at first - she had to work long hours and face tough competition from other reporters - but Olivia was determined to succeed.\n\nOver the years, Olivia has become known for her persistence and tenacity. She never gives up on a story, no matter how difficult or dangerous it may be.

            "response_2": "Character Name: Seraphina Thorne\n\nBackground Story:\n\nSeraphina Thorne was born into a family of wealth and prestige in the bustling city of Silverhaven. Her father, Lord Percival Thorne, was a prominent merchant who had built his fortune through his vast network of trade connections, while her mother, Lady Evelyn Thorne, was a skilled diplomat with a talent for navigating the treacherous waters of high society.\n\nFrom a young age, Seraphina was groomed to be the perfect lady. She was taught the arts of needlework, dancing, and etiquette by the finest tutors in the land. However, her true passion lay in books. Seraphina had a voracious appetite for knowledge, and she would spend hours poring over the vast library her father had amassed, absorbing everything from the histories of ancient civilizations to the arcane secrets of forgotten magical tomes.\n\nWhen Seraphina was 15 years old, her world was shattered. Her father was accused of being involved in a plot to overthrow the king, and the Thorne family found themselves cast out of high society and stripped of their titles. Lord Thorne was imprisoned, and Lady Thorne, in her despair, fell gravely ill.\n\nDetermined to clear her father's name and restore her family's honor, Seraphina embarked on a dangerous journey to uncover the truth behind the conspiracy. Along the way, she honed her skills in swordplay and discovered a latent talent for magic, passed down from her mother's side of the family.\n\nSeraphina's journey took her to the far reaches of the kingdom, where she encountered a diverse array of characters and creatures, both friend and foe. She formed a bond with a misfit group of adventurers, each with their own goals and reasons for joining her quest. Among them were a wise-cracking rogue with a heart of gold, a stoic warrior haunted by his past, and a mysterious sorceress with a hidden agenda.\n\nTogether, they navigated treacherous dungeons, battled fearsome monsters, and unraveled the threads of the conspiracy that had ensnared Seraphina's family. Ultimately, they discovered that the true mastermind behind the plot was a powerful and nefarious sorcerer who sought to plunge the kingdom into chaos and seize the throne for himself.\n\nIn the climactic final battle, Seraphina and her allies confronted the sorcerer and his minions in a desperate struggle for the fate of the kingdom. Through her courage, cunning, and newfound magical abilities, Seraphina was able to defeat the sorcerer and expose his treachery.\n\nWith her father's name cleared and her family's honor restored, Seraphina returned to Silverhaven as a hero. She was granted a pardon by the grateful king, and the Thorne family was once again welcomed back into the halls of power. But Seraphina was forever changed by her experiences, and she knew that her life would never again be solely about the trappings of high society.\n\nSeraphina Thorne had become a true adventurer, with a thirst for knowledge and a drive to defend her kingdom from the forces of darkness. And though she had won a great victory, she knew that her story was far from over. For there were still countless mysteries to unravel, treasures to discover, and battles to be fought. And Seraphina Thorne was ready to face them all.",
