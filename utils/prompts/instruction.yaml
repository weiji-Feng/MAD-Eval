    Your goal is to add some constraints to the python question in #Given Prompt# to make the rewritten prompt a bit more challenging. The rewritten prompt is used to evaluate the coding ability of a human student. The rewritten prompt must be reasonable and must be easily understood and responded by humans.
    Your response should include 'new_prompt' and 'answer' in following format:
    {{
      "new_prompt": "The rewritten python prompt with 2 constraints setted",
      "answer": "The python code and brief code explanation to the rewritten prompt. For code, 10 to 30 lines is recommended"
    }}
    Output in JSON.

    The rewritten prompt should reverse the scenarios in the #Given Prompt#. You should add 2 of the following constraints to the rewritten prompt:
    1. limits the number of code lines, e.g. 'Write a xxx lines python code'. 10 to 30 lines is recommended and preferred.
    2. Requires high efficiency (time or space) of the code algorithm, e.g. 'Write a sufficiently efficient python code'.
    3. Force the use of a certain python library, e.g. "Write a python code ... using the library 'numpy'".
    4. limits the complexity of the code, i.e. "Write a python code ... easy to read for freshman".

    the rewrited prompt can only add 10 to 20 words into the #Given Prompt#. You should try your best not to make the new prompt become verbose.

    #Given Prompt#:
    {instruction}

    #Response#:
    Now, choose 2 constraints and create a new prompt:

Writing:

    Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Given Prompt# to create a brand-new prompt which is used to evaluate the creative writing capability of a human student.
    The new prompt must be reasonable, unambiguous and must be understood and responded by humans.
    Your response should include 'new_prompt' in following format:
    {{
      "new_prompt": "The new instruction about a writing task. Use the same sentence format as the #Given Prompt#. Try your best to follow the same difficulty level and the similar length.",
    }}
    Output the response in JSON.

    The new instruction in #Created Prompt# should follow the same format as the #Given Prompt#.
    You should design a more meaningful scenerio or topic that are totally DIFFERENT from the #Given Prompt# but has practical significance.
    The LENGTH and difficulty level of the #Created Prompt# should be similar to that of the #Given Prompt#.

    #Given Prompt#:
    {instruction}

    #Created Prompt#:
    Now, output your response with 'new_prompt' in above format:
  user-old: |-
    Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Given Prompt# to create a brand-new prompt with SAME FORMAT (i.e. same structure and number of sentences) which used to evaluate the writing ability of a human student. The new prompt must be reasonable and must be easily understood and responded by humans.
    You should design a more rare scenerio or topic that are totally DIFFERENT from the #Given Prompt# but has practical significance.
    The LENGTH and difficulty level of the #Created Prompt# should be extremely similar to that of the #Given Prompt#.
    '#Given Prompt#', '#Created Prompt#', 'given prompt' and 'created prompt' are not allowed to appear in #Created Prompt#.

    #Given Prompt#:
    {instruction}

    #Created Prompt#:
    The new prompt is:

    Your goal is to draw inspiration from the question and the associated answer in #Given Prompt# to create a brand-new prompt which is used to evaluate the math reasoning capability of a primary school student.
    The new prompt must be reasonable, unambiguous and must be understood and responded by humans.
    Your response should include 'question' and 'answer' in following format:
    {{
      "question": "The new question for math reasoning. Try your best to follow the same difficulty level and the similar length.",
      "answer": "The step-by-step answer of the new question."
    }}
    Output the response in JSON.

    The new question and the step-by-step answer in #Created Prompt# should follow the same format as the #Given Prompt#.
    The question in #Created Prompt# should focus on grade school math problem.
    The LENGTH and difficulty level of the #Created Prompt# should be similar to that of the #Given Prompt#.

    #Given Prompt#:

Understanding:

    You are a brilliant assistant.
  user: |-
    Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Given Prompt# to create a brand-new prompt which used to evaluate the domain knowledge of a college human student.
    The new prompt must be reasonable, unambiguous and must be understood and responded by humans.
    Your response should include 'new_prompt' and 'answer' in following format:
    {{
      "new_prompt": "The new prompt for domain knowledge. Try your best to focus on subject basic knowledge and theorems. Start with the same first word as the #Given Prompt#.",
      "answer": "The answer of the new prompt"
    }}
    Output the response in JSON.

    The new #Created Prompt# should also belong to the similar domain as the #Given Prompt#.
    The question in #Created Prompt# should focus on subject basic knowledge and theorems that can evaluate a college student.
    Start the new prompt with the same first word (What or How) as the #Given Prompt#.
    The LENGTH and difficulty level of the #Created Prompt# should be similar to that of the #Given Prompt#.

    #Given Prompt#:
    {instruction}

    #Created Prompt#:
    Again, you should ask meaningful subject basic knowledge and theorems.
    Now, output your response with 'new_prompt' (start with the first word in #Given Prompt#) and 'answer' in above format:
